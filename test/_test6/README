version dd5b483.

The file doesn't parse on Zsh <= 5.4.2. The reason is closing parenthesis not
at the same line as $(. Expected test result is failure, and make doesn't get
error. The test7 uses the same zshrc but skip-condition is reversed and
expected result is correct parsing. The test8 uses the same file but with the
problematic syntax fixed and no skip condition (test always enabled).
